Summarise your findings here (see specification).


The goal is to find the difficulty level for Sudoku mystery boards.

Solving user time is an indicator for the solving algorithm duration, hence the higher user time means higher difficulty.

Running following command:
time ./tester filename

easy.dat = 0.00s
medium.dat = 0.01s
mystery1.dat = 0.29s
mystery2.dat = -
mystery3.dat = 0.01s

Following on mystery2, output from the sudoku executable file is:

"

Loading Sudoku board from file 'mystery2.dat'... Success!
A solution cannot be found.

"

The algorithm cannot solve the particular board 'mystery2.dat'. As the algorithm is exhaustive, the more likely explanation is that board 'mystery2.dat' is unsolvable.

User time to solve 'mystery1.dat' > 'mystery3.dat', so board 'mystery1.dat' is the "extremely hard" difficulty level while 'mystery3.dat' board is the "hard" difficulty level.

Notice that boards 'medium.dat' and 'mystery3.dat' is close, so I investigated the number of function calls for solve_board and received output for each file:

easy.dat = 2949
medium.dat = 20316
mystery1.dat = 558780
mystery2.dat = -
mystery3.dat = 21540

The results reiterates previous findings, and confirmed that 'mystery3.dat' board, which is "hard" in difficulty takes longer to solve than 'medium.dat" even though by a not very significant margin. This might indicate that both boards are close to the the medium-high level boundary.


Conclusion:

mystery1.dat = "extremely hard" difficulty
mystery2.dat = impossible to solve
mystery3.dat = "hard" difficulty
